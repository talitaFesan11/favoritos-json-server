## Deploy to Vercel

Will sleep after a while.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Sign Up or login into [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
3. From the Vercel dashboard, click "**+ New Project**" then "**Import**" your repository.
4. In the "**Configure Project**" screen, leave everything default and click "**Deploy**".
5. Wait until deployment is done, and your own JSON server is ready to serve!
